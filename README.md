Odin project menu recipe

This is my first project from The Odin Project, where I decided to create a website to present my own restaurant, Mezoo Good Food. Throughout this project, I will apply everything I have learned in the course to build a professional, functional website for my restaurant.

My ultimate goal is to create a seamless user experience, showcasing the restaurant's offerings, and eventually developing an order-taking system along with a dashboard for managing orders and restaurant operations.
