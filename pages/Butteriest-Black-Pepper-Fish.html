    <h1><u>Butteriest Black Pepper Fish</u></h1>

    <p>Barely cracked peppercorns toasted, almost fried, in a generous amount of butter create one of the easiest, best finishers for seared fish. The black pepper’s piercing heat fizzles down to reveal warm, leathery, fruit-like flavors, a good reminder that black pepper is much more than just a default seasoning. We love the Zanzibar and Robusta peppercorns from Burlap & Barrel. On the topic of fish, any thin fillets of white fish that catch your fancy will do well here—sole, turbot, even snapper.</p>
    <ul><h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
        <li>2 tsp. black peppercorns</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 4-oz. skinless flounder fillets</li>
        <li>½ tsp. freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. vegetable oil</li>
        <li>6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. finely grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>Finely chopped parsley (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><h3><u>Preparation</u></h3>
        <li>Coarsely crush <strong>2 tsp. black peppercorns</strong>  with a mortar and pestle or place on a work surface and crush with a heavy skillet; set crushed pepper aside.</li>
        <li>Place <strong>3 Tbsp. all-purpose flour</strong>  in a shallow bowl. Sprinkle <strong>two 4-oz. skinless flounder </strong> fillets on both sides with ½ tsp. freshly ground pepper (this is not the reserved pepper you just crushed) and 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt. Working one at a time, dredge fillets in flour, shaking off excess.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Cook fish, undisturbed, until golden underneath, about 2 minutes. Carefully turn over with a spatula and cook on the other side just until cooked through, about 30 seconds. Transfer each fillet to a plate.</li>
        <li>Wipe out skillet. Combine 6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces, and reserved crushed pepper in pan and cook over medium-low heat, swirling pan occasionally, until butter foams, then browns (be careful not to let it burn), 5–8 minutes; remove from heat. Stir 1 Tbsp. finely grated lemon zest and 2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice and remaining ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt into butter.</li>
        <li>Immediately spoon sauce over fish and top with finely chopped parsley.</li>
    </ol>
