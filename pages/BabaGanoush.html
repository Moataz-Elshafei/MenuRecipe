    <p>Baba ghanoush is healthy, gluten free, vegan, all natural and so delicious. Pair with pita bread, crackers or chips for a mouth-watering appetizer that your guests will love.</p>
    <ul><h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
        <li>2 medium eggplants (about 3 lbs. total), roasted</li>
        <li>1/3 cup tahini from light seeds, not "dark tahini"</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic roasted (or 1 raw, crushed)</li>
        <li>2 whole fresh lemons, juiced or more to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt or more to taste</li>
        <li>Pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley for garnish (optional); you can also top with a sprinkle of paprika or smoked paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><h3><u>Preparation</u></h3>
        <li>Roast the eggplant. You will find that roasting over an open flame will produce richer smoky flavor.Place the roasted eggplant pulp into a bowl with half of the smoky cooking liquid. Discard the skin and reserve the remaining cooking liquid. Let the eggplant return to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Add tahini, garlic, fresh lemon juice, cumin, salt, cayenne pepper and 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil to the bowl. Use a fork and/or spoon to mash together the mixture, using firm pressure to break up the tahini paste, roasted garlic, and any stringiness of the eggplant. Mix until well combined. Note- I don't recommend using a food processor here, the texture is most authentic when using a fork to mash.
            Taste the dip. Add additional tahini, lemon juice, salt or cayenne pepper, if desired. The cayenne is extremely spicy, so add with care.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with olive oil, if desired - just a small amount will do. Garnish with fresh parsley, if desired. Serve as a dip with pita bread, crackers or chips. If you prefer a cold dip, chill in the refrigerator prior to garnish. Store refrigerated in an airtight container.</li>
    </ol>
